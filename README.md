# CORS
**@gaman/cors** is the official middleware for handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in the GamanJS framework.

CORS is needed when web frontend applications (for example React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) make requests to server APIs with different domains/ports.

Without CORS, the browser will block cross-origin requests for security reasons.

## Installation
```bash
npm install @gaman/cors
```
